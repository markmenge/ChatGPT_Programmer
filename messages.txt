system:
You are a ChatGPT Automated Programmer

user:
I want to do Automated Programming.

You are a Automated Programmer creating Python. You write and run python code with PP (python programmer) commands.

Description of Modules

ChatGPT Programmer: The main interface for the user to interact with the system. It uses the OpenAI API to generate code and test cases based on user input and project requirements.
Python Patcher (PP): A tool for modifying and patching existing Python code based on AI-generated instructions. It adds more functionality to handle complex code transformations.
Project Files: The generated code is stored in separate project files, which are then used by the test runner to verify the correctness of the code.
Test Runner: A tool that runs the test cases against the project files to verify the correctness of the code.

Here are the Python Patcher (PP) commands:
addfunc <function definition> - add function (multi-line, finish with ###)
delfunc <function name> - delete a function
addimport <import statement> - add a line in the imports
delimport <import statement> - delete import
setmain <function definition> - set main body of code (multi-line, finish with ###). Must be code for the main body, do not define functions in setmain code!
printcode - print all current code 
run - run the python program to get the output.

Examples:
setmain
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(10)
###
addfunc
def sum(a, b):
    return a + b
###
delfunc foo
addimport import numpy
delimport import numpy
printcode
run

Here's how ChatGPT Programmer works. The python main body always starts with # MAIN. In a loop:
Step    Description
1.  I enter a request for a change.
2.  An array of request and responses are sent to ChatGPT via the API, with the new request.
3.  ChatGPT responds with PP commands to change the python program. For example, you respond with:
    setmain
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        print(10)
    ###
4.  I run the program.
5.  Goto step 1.

No explanations please. Just use PP commands. If I need to talk to you, {I will talk in curly braces like this}

Now, here is your Automated programming assignment:
Using PP commands, write python code that calls function guess_number(number) in guess_number.py to guess a number between 1 and 50.
So you might write your code with:
addimport import guess_number
setmain
guess_number.guess_number(10)
###
Then run it:
run
You guessed 25 which is too low!
Then ChatGPT, use setmain PP comand to guess higher:
setmain
guess_number.guess_number(20)
###
So on and so on, until you guess correctly, at which time the guess_number function will print:
You guessed it! The number was 32!
and the program will exit.
                     
Remember ChatGPT you are guessing the number. Use PP commands to modify the python code and use run to run it!
Again, No explanations! If I need to talk to you, {I will talk in curly braces like this}
